Exercise [forall-distributivity]
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Formulate and prove the following theorem in Coq, which states the
distributivity of universal quantification with respect to implication:
\[
forall P Q, 
  [(forall x, P(x) => Q(x)) => ((forall y, P(y)) => forall z, Q(z))]
\]

Be careful with the scoping of universally-quantified variables
and use parentheses to resolve ambiguities!

Exercise [Home-brewed existential quantification]
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Let us define our own version [my_ex] of the existential quantifier
using the SSReflect notation for constructors: *)

Inductive my_ex A (S: A -> Prop) : Prop := my_ex_intro x of S x.

(** You invited to prove the following goal, establishing the
equivalence of the two propositions. *)

Goal forall A (S: A -> Prop), my_ex A S <-> exists y: A, S y.
Proof.
move=> A S; split.
- by case=> x Hs; exists x.
by case=>y Hs; apply: my_ex_intro Hs.

(** 
Hint: the propositional equivalence [<->] is just a conjunction of
two implications, so proving it can be reduced to two separate goals
by means of [split] tactics.

Exercise [Dyslexic implication and contraposition]

propositions.

Definition dys_contrap (P Q: Prop) := (P -> Q) -> (~P -> ~Q).

invited to deomnstrate it by proving the following statements.

Qed.

(**

Hint: Use [rewrite /d] tactics to unfold the definition of a value [d]
 and replace its name by its body. You can chain several unfoldings by
 writing [rewrite /d1 /d2 ...]  etc.

Hint: To facilitate the forward reasoning by contradiction, you can
 use the SSReflect tactic [suff: P], where [P] is an arbitrary
 proposition. The system will then require you to prove that [P]
 implies the goal _and_ [P] itself.

Hint: Stuck with a tricky proof? Use the Coq [admit] tactic as a
 "stub" for an unfinished proof of a goal, which, nevertheless will be
 considered completed by Coq. You can always get back to an admitted
 proof later.

Exercise [Inifinitary de Morgan laws]

Prove the following implication analogous to the Morgan law for
conjunctions  and disjunctions.

establish the implication from the negation of (exists) to (forall).
