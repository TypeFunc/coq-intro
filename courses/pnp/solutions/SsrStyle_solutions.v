Exercise [Gorgeous reflection]
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Gorgeous and beautiful numbers, defining, in fact, exactly the same
subset of [nat] are a particular case of Frobenius coin problem, which
asks for the largest integer amount of money, that cannot be obtained
using only coins of specified denominations.  In the case of
[beautiful] and [gorgeous] numbers we have two denominations
available, namely 3 and 5. An explicit formula exists for the case
of only two denominations n_1 and n_2, which allows one to compute
the Frobenius number as 

g(n_1, n_2) = n_1 * n_2 - n_1 - n_2. 

That said, for the case n_1 = 3 and n_2 = 5 the Frobenius number is 7,
which means that all numbers greater or equal than 8 are in fact
beautiful and gorgeous (since the two are equivalent, as was
established by the previous exercise).

In this exercise, we suggest the reader to prove that the efficient
procedure of "checking" for gorgeousness is in fact correct. First,
let us defined the following candidate function.

*)

Fixpoint gorgeous_b n : bool := match n with 
 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 7 => false
 | _ => true
 end. 

(** 

The ultimate goal of this exercise is to prove the proposition
[reflect (gorgeous n) (gorgeous_b n)], which would mean that the two
representations are equivalent. Let us divide the proof into two
stages:

- The first stage is proving that all numbers greater or equal than
  8 are gorgeous. To prove thism it might be useful to have the
  following two facts established:

Hint: Use the tactic [constructor i] to prove a goal, which is an
n-ary disjunction, which is satisfied if its i-th disjunct is true.

Lemma repr3 n : n >= 8 ->

Proof.
elim: n=>//[|n Ih]; first by apply: g_0; rewrite muln0.
by rewrite mulnSr; apply: (g_plus3 _ (3*n)).
Qed.

(** 

Next, we can establish by induction the following criteria using the
lemmas [repr3] and [gorg3] in the subgoals of the proof.

*)

Lemma gorg_criteria n : n >= 8 -> gorgeous n.
Proof.
case/repr3=>k; case=>->{n}.
- apply: (g_plus5 _ (3*k + 3)); last by rewrite -addnA.
  by apply: (g_plus3 _ (3*k))=>//; apply: gorg3.
- apply: (g_plus3 _ (3*k + 6))=>//; last by rewrite -addnA.
  apply: (g_plus3 _ (3*k + 3))=>//; last by rewrite -addnA.
  by apply: (g_plus3 _ (3*k))=>//; apply: gorg3.
apply: (g_plus5 _ (3*k + 5))=>//; last by rewrite -addnA.
by apply: (g_plus5 _ (3*k))=>//; apply: gorg3.
Qed.

(** 

This makes the proof of the following lemma trivial.

*)

Lemma gorg_refl' n: n >= 8 -> reflect (gorgeous n) true.
Proof. by move/gorg_criteria=>H; constructor. Qed.

(** 

- In the second stage of the proof of reflection, we will
  need to prove four totally boring but unavoidable lemmas.

Hint: The rewriting lemmas [addnC] and [eqSS] from the [ssrnat]
module might be particularly useful here.

*)

Lemma not_g1: ~(gorgeous 1).
Proof.
case=>//n Ih /eqP; first by rewrite addn3 eqSS.

Qed.

Lemma not_g2: ~(gorgeous 2).

case: n Ih=>//n Ih.

(** 

We can finally provide prove the ultimate reflection predicate,
relating [gorgeous] and [gorgeous_b].

Exercise [Boolean element inclusion predicate for lists]

Assuming a type [X] with the boolean equality (i.e., elements of [X]
can be compared for being equal using the [==] operator returning
[true] or [false]), define a recursive funciton [appears_in] on lists

Exercise ["All" predicate for lists]

Define two version of version of "all-elements-satisfy" predicate for
lists. 

- The version [all] takes a type [X], a predicate [P : X -> Prop] and
  a list [ls: seq X] and returns element of sort [Prop] which carries
  a proof that all elements of ls satisfy [P].

Prove the following lemma, stating that the two representations are
equivalent whenever [P] and [test] are equivalent:
