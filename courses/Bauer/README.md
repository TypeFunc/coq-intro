# Coq and Proof General Intro Notes

## Installing Coq and the Proof General/Emacs IDE
On Ubuntu Linux (version 14.04 and probably others) Coq and Proof General are
easily installed with the Synaptic package manager.

## Andrej Bauer's YouTube tutorials
Andrej Bauer provides a nice series of [nine short YouTube tutorials][] about using Coq.
For example, in [How to use Coq with Proof General][], he shows how to use Coq
to prove that Pierce's law is equivalent to the Law of Excluded Middle.  

The file Bauer.v contains Coq code based on Andrej's tutorials.
