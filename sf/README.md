## SoftwareFoundations

This directory contains the
[Software Foundations book](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/index.html)
by Peirce, et al (hereinafter referred to as "the sf book"), as well as some
other stuff related to that book, such as my adulterated version of the book,
including my (possibly wrong) solutions.

The subdirectories are these (as of Summer 2015):

+ **notes** some of my personal notes/excerpts highlighting only a few of the
  most important concepts and proof tactics.
  
+ **sf-pdf** pdf versions of the sf book.

+ ~~**sf-solutions-wjd**  modified versions of the files
comprising the sf book, including (possibly wrong) solutions to some of the
exercises.~~ This directory has been deleted and its commit history purged.
(Reminder: Please don't post solutions to exercises from the sf book online.
Doing so diminishes the value of sf as a textbook for classroom use.)
