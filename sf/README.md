## SoftwareFoundations

This directory contains the
[Software Foundations book](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/index.html)
by Peirce, et al (hereinafter referred to as "the sf book"), as well as some
other stuff related to that book, such as my adulterated version of the book,
including my (possibly wrong) solutions.

The subdirectories are these (as of Summer 2015):

+ **sf-solutions-wjd**  my most recent modified versions of the files
comprising the sf book, including (possibly wrong) solutions to some of the exercises.

+ **sf-original-Jan2015** the original versions of the main files from sf.tar.gz (the sf book).

+ **sf-pdf** pdf versions of the sf book.

+ **sf-old-solutions-wjd** edited files from the SF book, including solutions
from the first time I went through the first 5 or 6 chapters of the book.
(I will remove this subdirectory eventually.)
