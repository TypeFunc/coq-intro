\noindent {\bf Preamble.} This is an unofficial pdf version of the Software Foundations book.
The official version (in html format) is available at\\
\\
\url{http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/index.html}\\
\\
This pdf file was created with the following command

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
    coqdoc -t Software Foundations -toc --toc-depth 1 --no-lib-name  /
        --latex --files-from filelist.txt -o sf.tex 
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent (The forward slash at the end of the line should not typed.)\\
\\
A title page, author list, and this preamble page were added manually 
(by including the file {\small {\tt title-author-preamble.tex}} in the {\small
  {\tt sf.tex}} file).  Also, the color option of the coqdoc package was used.  
More precisely, in the sf.tex file, the line
{\small 
\begin{verbatim}
    \usepackage{coqdoc}
\end{verbatim}
}
was replaced with the lines

{\small 
\begin{verbatim}
    \usepackage{xcolor}
    \usepackage[color]{coqdoc}
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent Finally, the command {\tt pdflatex sf.tex} was invoked a couple of times to
produce the final {\tt sf.pdf} file. \\
